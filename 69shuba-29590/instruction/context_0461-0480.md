### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 460–479)
*   **Emlyn White joins the Tarot Club (Chaps 469–470):** Emlyn White officially becomes a member of the Tarot Club with the code name "The Moon" (Nguyệt Lượng). He was initially sent by the Sanguine ancestor Nibis Odora to pray to The Fool as a test/provocation, but Klein turned it into a recruitment opportunity. Emlyn's psychological suggestion from Bishop Utravsky has been partially removed by Klein's purification.
*   **The Time Loop in the City of Silver (Chaps 462–468):** Derrick's exploration team was trapped in a recurring time loop inside the Fallen Creator's temple. The loop was caused by the residual power of the "Fate Angel" Ouroboros. Derrick broke the cycle by attacking the symbolic "river" in the mural and destroying the composite face on the chest of the boy, Jack.
*   **The Identity of the Prince's Lover (Chaps 471–472):** The woman Prince Edessak is infatuated with is revealed to be Triss (now Triss Cheek). Her name "Cheek" is a direct reference to the true name of the "Primordial Demoness" (Nguyên Sơ Ma Nữ). She is being used as a pawn/host for a high-level ritual.
*   **The Great Fog of Backlund (Chaps 476–478):** A catastrophic event triggered by a collaboration between the Royal Family (Prince Edessak's faction), the Demoness Sect (represented by Despair Lady), and the Aurora Order (represented by Mr. A). The fog is a massive biological and mystical weapon designed to cover up a ritual and wipe out evidence by causing mass deaths in the East District.
*   **Sealed Artifact 0-08's Counterattack (Chaps 473–475):** Ince Zangwill continues to use the "Quill of Alzuhod" (0-08) to manipulate events. The quill has a tendency to write mocking stories about Ince (e.g., his pants falling down) when it tries to over-manipulate a situation. Klein survives a meteor strike via 0-08's "coincidences" only because of Azik's intervention.
*   **Sealed Artifact 0-17 (Chap 475):** A dangerous Grade 0 artifact kept by the Church of Evernight, revealed to be a "living angel" who has lost all intelligence. Anyone who approaches it disappears from reality.
