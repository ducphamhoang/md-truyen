### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 281–290)
*   **The Lanvus Execution**: After discovering that Lanvus was hiding in the Dockworkers Union (Công đoàn Công nhân Bến tàu), Klein (Sherlock) coordinates with Audrey to alert the Nighthawks. The 'Red Gloves' led by High Deacon Crestet Cesim intervene. 
*   **The God-Seed Revelation**: It is revealed that the True Creator (Chân Thực Tạo Vật Chủ) implanted a '神性树苗' (Mầm non thần tính/God-seed) inside Lanvus. Lanvus actually manipulated the Nighthawks into attacking him so that their 'Saint Selena Bone Sword' (1-63) would sever his connection to the god, allowing him to escape being a vessel.
*   **The Sewer Duel**: Klein tracks the weakened Lanvus into the sewers. Using his 'Clown' (Hề Giả) abilities, 'Slumber Charms', and Tarot cards as projectiles, Klein kills Lanvus, finally avenging Dunn Smith and the Tingen Nighthawks. 
*   **Tarot Club Signature**: To mask his identity and send a message, Klein leaves a variety of Tarot cards (The World, Death, Emperor, etc.) covering Lanvus's corpse, creating a 'mystical ritual' crime scene that baffles the authorities but signals the Tarot Club's power to Audrey.
*   **Clown Digestion**: Upon killing Lanvus and experiencing the bitter irony of his success, Klein fully digests the 'Clown' potion.
*   **The Participant Badge**: Klein loots a mysterious badge from Lanvus with the inscription '持有此物，即可加入' (Nắm giữ vật này, có thể gia nhập), implying Lanvus belonged to another hidden organization.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS
*   **Sherlock Moriarty ↔ Jurgen Cooper**: Formalized professional bond. Jurgen is now Klein's official legal counsel, assisting with bail and legal protection for his 'investigative activities'.
*   **Sherlock Moriarty ↔ Crestet Cesim**: Unseen interaction. Klein observes the High Deacon's terrifying power with a Grade 1 Sealed Artifact from a distance.
