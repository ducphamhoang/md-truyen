### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 271–280)
*   **The Serial Killer Case**: Investigative journalist Mike Joseph hires Sherlock Moriarty (Klein) to provide protection while investigating a string of murders. The victims are women whose internal organs have been removed. Mike discovers a pattern: although they had various current jobs (teachers, factory workers), almost all were former street girls. This points to a ritualistic selection by a "Devil" pathway Beyonder.
*   **Gold Rose Brothel & Capin**: The investigation leads to the "Gold Rose" (Hoa Hồng Vàng), a brothel run by Madam Lopez. They overhear Lopez mention "Capin" (a controversial tycoon) and instructions not to "send more people over," hinting at human trafficking operations in Backlund.
*   **The Hunt for Lanvus**: Hugh continues her search for the fraudster Lanvus using her East District informant, Williams. However, a mysterious figure (linked to the power behind Lanvus) tracks Williams down, interrogates him about who is looking for Lanvus, and kills him in a magically induced gas explosion. This escalates the danger of the Lanvus investigation.
*   **Sealing the Ruins**: Klein decides to seal the entrance to the Fourth Epoch ruins on Williams Street to prevent accidental leaks of the Evil Spirit. He enlists the help of the pale lady (revealed as Sharon), who turns out to be an expert in spiritual concealment and demolition. They prepare to collapse the entrance under the guise of private renovation.
*   **Tarot Club Logistics**: Klein (as The World) purchases the "Hurricane Axe" (Rìu Cuồng Phong) for Derrick (The Sun) at a Beyonder gathering. He also sells the recipes for "Bard" and "Light Supplicant" to fund his advancement and equipment.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS
*   **Sherlock Moriarty ↔ Mike Joseph**: Professional/Client. Mike provides Klein with deep sociological insights into Backlund's underbelly and current events.
*   **Sherlock Moriarty ↔ Sharon**: Collaborator. The "Black Dress Lady" is formally identified as Sharon (莎伦). She agrees to help Klein seal the ruins for free because it aligns with her goals (preventing the Evil Spirit's escape and keeping the ruins accessible only to herself as a spirit).
*   **Hugh ↔ Williams (Deceased)**: Informant/Friend. Williams's death impacts Hugh deeply and reveals that Lanvus is protected by high-level Beyonder threats.
*   **Sherlock Moriarty ↔ Talim Dumont**: Professional acquaintance. Talim, a horse-riding teacher, acts as a bridge to the journalist and middle-class social circles.
