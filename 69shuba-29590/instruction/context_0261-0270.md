### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 261–270)
*   **The Williams Street Ruins**: Sherlock Moriarty (Klein) explores the underground ruins beneath Miller Carter's home. He discovers Fourth Epoch architecture characterized by black stone, upside-down chandeliers, and asymmetry. The ruins contain six rooms with humanoid statues of the six orthodox gods (excluding Steam), which is considered unusual/blasphemous. Deep inside, Klein encounters a "bloody door" and a powerful Evil Spirit (Ác Linh) seated in blood-stained armor. He narrowly escapes after being infected with "Black Worms" (Sâu đen).
*   **The Tarot Club's Expansion**: Klein introduces a new member, "The World" (Thế Giới), who is actually a puppet controlled by Klein from above the Gray Fog. This allows Klein to participate in trades and ask questions without breaking his persona as "The Fool."
*   **High Sequence Secrets**: Through Roselle's diary and the Tarot Club, Klein learns of "Sequence 0" (Danh sách 0), the level of true godhood, and that each pathway can only have one Sequence 0 at a time. He also learns about the existence of "Blasphemy Cards" (Thẻ bài Tiết Lộ) created by Roselle to hide the 22 pathways' secrets.
*   **Roselle's Family**: The diary reveals Roselle's children: his daughter Bernadette (who is predicted to hate him and become a figure in the Beyonder world), and his sons Charles and Bonova (who was born a Sequence 5 Astrologer).
*   **Copper Whistle Testing**: Klein conducts experiments at Auston Cemetery and St. Estin Hospital. He confirms that Azik's Copper Whistle only induces reanimation (Living Corpses) in bodies that have not received official "Requiem" (An hồn) rituals.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS
*   **Sherlock Moriarty ↔ Miller Carter**: Professional client relationship regarding the Williams Street investigation.
*   **The Fool ↔ The World**: Klein and his "smurf" account/puppet used to facilitate internal Tarot Club logistics.
*   **Roselle ↔ Bernadette Hallam**: A complex father-daughter dynamic foretold by the Seer Zaratul.
