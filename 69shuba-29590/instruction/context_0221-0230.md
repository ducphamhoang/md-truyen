## NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 221–230)
*   **Adjacent Pathways Unveiled**: The "Fool" (Klein) reveals that certain Beyonder pathways can be safely switched at high sequences (Sequence 4 and above). For example, the "Death" pathway's "Gatekeeper" (Sequence 5) can advance to the "Warrior" pathway's "Demon Hunter" (Sequence 4).
*   **Sacrificial & Bestowal Rituals**: Klein successfully tests a new method for exchanging physical items through the gray mist. **Alger** (The Hanged Man) sacrifices a Beyonder ingredient which Klein then bestows upon **Audrey** (Justice).
*   **Sherlock Moriarty’s First Cases**: Klein begins his life as a detective in Backlund. He solves a minor case of a missing cat (**Brody**) and takes on a dangerous commission to find the missing detective **Zerial Victor Lee**.
*   **The Murder of Zerial**: Klein discovers Zerial’s mutilated corpse in the sewers. Through spirit channeling and investigation, he discovers Zerial was murdered by members of the **Ziman'ge Party**, specifically their "Executioner" **Meursault**.
*   **Assassination Attempt**: After Klein refuses to help Meursault find a boy named **Ian Wright**, Meursault attacks Klein at his home. Klein narrowly wins the life-and-death struggle, killing Meursault with a lethal "thrown" paper contract.
*   **International Intrigue**: Spirit channeling Meursault reveals he was working for an **Intis Ambassador** in Backlund. The Ambassador is seeking a mysterious and "very important" item currently held by Ian Wright.
*   **Technological Investment**: Klein invests 100 gold pounds into the inventor **Lepard**, who is developing a human-powered vehicle (a precursor to the bicycle) based on the forbidden sketches of Emperor Roselle.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS
*   **Klein & Jurgen Cooper**: Klein gains the friendship and gratitude of the "Senior Solicitor" Jurgen and his grandmother Doris after finding their lost cat.
*   **Klein & Ian Wright**: A professional bond forms between the detective and the street-smart boy. Klein views Ian as a gateway to the Backlund underworld.
*   **Audrey, Hugh & Fors**: Audrey subtly guides her friends **Hugh** and **Fors Wall** toward the "Fool." Hugh's accidental recitation of Klein’s honorific name results in a brief, terrifying encounter with the gray mist.
*   **The Ziman'ge Party (Hostile)**: Klein is now an enemy of this powerful Backlund gang and their mysterious backer, the Intis Ambassador.
