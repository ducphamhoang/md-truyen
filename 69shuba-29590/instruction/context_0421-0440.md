### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 420–431)
*   **The Fall of a Duke**: Duke Pallas Negan is assassinated in a high-class villa by the Desire Apostle (Jason Beria). Despite having a Sequence 6 'Wind Blessed' guard and a Sequence 5 secretary (Lockhart Siakam), the Duke dies from his own amplified fear. The official story blames the 'Aurora Order' and the 'Black Emperor' persona for the cover-up.
*   **Sealed Artifact 1-42**: Known as 'The Mad Armor' or 'Bloody Armor', this Sequence 1 artifact requires the wearer to be submerged in hot water immediately after use to disperse silver-patterned corruption. Leonard Mitchell wears it during the pursuit.
*   **The Twilight Hermit Order**: Revealed as the ancient organization behind the assassination. They manipulate historical trends to awaken the 'True Creator'. Their members are elite figures across various fields. They rewarded Jason Beria with the 'Abyss' Blasphemy Card.
*   **The Abraham Inheritance**: Dorian Gray Abraham formally takes Fors Wall as his student. He uses a 'Void Creature' named Marmoth to transport items through the spirit world. He provides Fors with the 'Apprentice' and 'Trickmaster' materials.
*   **Talim's Death**: Talim Dumont dies suddenly of a curse at the Crag Club. Investigation is quickly taken over by the Royal Family, leading back to Prince Edessak Augustus.
