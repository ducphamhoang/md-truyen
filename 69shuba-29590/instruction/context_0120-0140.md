### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 121–140)
*   **The Triss Transformation**: The Nighthawks discover that 'Instigator' Tris has transformed into a woman named 'Triss' (Sequence 7 of the Demoness pathway). She attempted a large-scale curse in Tingen targeting survivors of the Alfalfa incident (including Joyce Meyer) before escaping via steam train.
*   **The Rampager Incident**: Klein assists Swain (owner of Evil Dragon Bar) in neutralizing a 'Punisher' (代罚者) who lost control and mutated into a fish-like monster. This highlights the tragic fate of Beyonders.
*   **Digestion and Progress**: Klein has fully digested the 'Seer' (Chiêm Bốc Gia) potion by adhering to his 'Seer Principles'. He begins 'paving the way' by subtly informing Dunn Smith about the 'Acting Method' (without naming it) to justify his rapid advancement.
*   **The City of Silver**: Klein pulls a new member into the Tarot Club from 'The Land Abandoned by God' (神弃之地). This member, Derrick Berg, lives in the City of Silver (Bạch Ngân Chi Thành), a place of eternal darkness and lightning where the dead turn into evil spirits unless killed by kin.
*   **The Azik Mystery**: During a mission to Lamud Town to exorcise a Black Armored Knight (Oan hồn Kỵ sĩ), Klein finds a painting of the 'First Baron Lamud' from over 1,000 years ago. The figure in the painting is identical to his teacher, Mr. Azik, including a distinctive mole near the ear.
*   **Sealed Artifact 3-0782**: A 'Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem' that purifies evil but causes anyone nearby to become 'Praise the Sun' (Tán dương Thái Dương) idiots if exposed for too long.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS
*   **Swain ↔ Nighthawks**: Professional respect. Swain is a former 'Punisher' captain who maintains a underground Beyonder market and calls upon the Nighthawks during emergencies.
*   **Klein ↔ Derrick Berg (The Sun)**: The Fool ↔ Follower. Derrick views 'The Fool' as a potential savior for the City of Silver.
*   **Klein ↔ Elizabeth**: Acquaintance. Elizabeth is a friend of Melissa who seeks Klein's help for her supernatural nightmares.
