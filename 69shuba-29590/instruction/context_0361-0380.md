### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 361–380)
* **Fourth Epoch Lore**: The Amon family is revealed as one of the five major families supporting the Tudor Dynasty, alongside Abraham, Antigonus, Jacob, and Tamara. They are known as "Blasphemers" (Dù thần giả) who steal divine power and claim descent from the Ancient Sun God.
* **The Amon Infiltration**: An avatar of Amon attempted to infiltrate the Gray Fog by parasitizing Derrick Berg. Klein successfully purged it using a modified "Secret Ritual" (Mật khế nghi thức) and the authority of the Black Emperor card.
* **Leonard's Secret**: Leonard Mitchell hosts a high-sequence entity named Pallez Zoroast, a "Parasitizer" (Ký sinh giả) of the Marauder pathway who is hiding from Amon.
* **Sanguine Life**: Emlyn White's parents are doctors who use bloodletting to collect food. Emlyn is a fanatical collector of dolls (nhân ngẫu). He remains trapped at the Harvest Church due to psychological suggestion.
* **The Capin Raid**: Klein identifies Capin as a major human trafficker in Backlund protected by high-sequence Beyonders (Heras, Katy, Parker). Klein initiates a raid in Spirit Body form, using the Black Emperor card to manifest a royal suit of armor and the "Biological Poison Bottle" to neutralize the guards.
