# NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 0241-0250)

### The Helmosuin Manuscript and the Spy War
The conflict intensifies as information about the manuscripts of **Turanné von Helmosuin** (the "Father of the Second-Generation Difference Engine") surfaces. **Ian Wright** reveals he was a spy trainee for the Feysac Empire under **Zereal Victor Lee**. The pursuit of these manuscripts involves three parties: Loen's **Military Intelligence Department 9 (MI9)**, Intis intelligence led by Ambassador **Bakerland**, and leftovers of the Feysac spy network. Klein (Sherlock) realizes he was caught in this high-level spy war due to a minor oversight in his initial identity setup.

### Klein's Preparations and the Bodyguard
Sensing a powerful premonition of danger, Klein takes aggressive measures. He attends a Beyonder gathering led by **Eye of Wisdom** where he sells a "Hunter" characteristic and buys a dangerous item: an ear from a "Listener" of the Aurora Order. On the gray fog, he uses this item to craft the **"Dirty Word" (Vũ Uế Chi Ngữ)** charm, which can inflict madness. Additionally, Klein hires a powerful, mysterious female bodyguard through **Maric** for 1,000 gold pounds for three days. This bodyguard is a pale woman in a black court dress who can manifest in mirrors.

### The Crag Club and the Gale Case
To maintain his detective persona and gather funds/connections, Klein accepts a "catching an affair" mission from **Mary Gale**. He tracks her husband, **Dorago Gale**, to the exclusive **Crag Club** (White Frost Club) and identifies his mistress, **Erika Taylor**. Mary rewards Klein by sponsoring his high-end membership at the club, providing him with a sophisticated base of operations.

### The Assassination Attempt on Bakerland
The Tarot Club's mission to kill the Ambassador proceeds. Audrey Hall (Justice) uses 10,000 gold pounds (borrowed from Glaint) to hire **Mr. A** of the Aurora Order. The first attempt involves a female assassin named **Irene**, who tries to kill Bakerland during a romantic tryst at the embassy. However, Bakerland, a Sequence 6 **Conspirator (Âm Mưu Gia)**, was prepared and neutralized her, revealing his deep-seated paranoia and combat experience.

### The Looming Shadow: Rosago
Ambassador Bakerland's top assistant and the mastermind behind the recent surveillance on Klein is identified as **Rosago**. Klein deduces Rosago is a high-sequence Beyonder of the **Seer** pathway (likely Sequence 5 **Marionettist - Bí Ngẫu Đại Sư**). Rosago is currently focused on the Helmosuin manuscripts but has orders to eliminate Klein once the operation is complete.
