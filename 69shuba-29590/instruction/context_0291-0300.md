### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 291–300)
*   **The Tarot Execution**: The death of Lanvus is staged as a ritualistic execution by the Tarot Club, with cards representing "The Fool", "Justice", "The Hanged Man", "The Sun", and "The World" scattered over his body. This leads MI9 and the Churches to believe a new, powerful secret organization has emerged in Backlund.
*   **Daly's Wrath**: Daly Simone is furious at High Deacon Crestet Cesim for excluding her from the Lanvus operation. She reveals a cold, professional side, expressing a desire to inflict necromantic torture on Lanvus as revenge for the Tingen team.
*   **Law of Characteristic Attraction**: Through Roselle's diary, Klein learns a fundamental law of mysticism: high-sequence Beyonder items/characteristics naturally and intermittently attract low-sequence Beyonders of the same pathway. This explains Klein's constant run-ins with the Secret Order and Antigonus-related entities.
*   **The Pirate Hierarchy**: The power structure of the Five Seas is expanded. It consists of **Four Kings (Tứ Vương)** and **Seven Admirals (Thất Tướng)**. Notable figures include the "King of Five Seas" Nast (possessing the ghost ship *Black Emperor*) and "Queen of Mystery" Bernadette (possessing the ship *Dawn*).
*   **Magician's Full Arsenal**: Advancing to Sequence 7, Klein gains nine specific abilities: Damage Transfer, Flame Jumping, Air Bullets, Paper Figurine Substitutes, Flame Manipulation, Illusion Creation, Underwater Breathing, Bone Softening, and Paper-to-Weapon.
*   **Roselle Memorial Exhibition**: A major exhibition of Roselle's original inventions and manuscripts is announced at the Kingdom Museum, sponsored by the Church of Steam and Machinery.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS
*   **Daly Simone ↔ Crestet Cesim**: Professional tension. Daly resents Cesim for "protecting" her from the Lanvus mission, viewing it as an insult to her professional status as a Nighthawk.
*   **Admiral of Stars (Cattleya) ↔ Queen of Mystery (Bernadette)**: Former mentor/student or superior/subordinate. Cattleya previously followed Bernadette before joining the Moses Ascetic Order.
