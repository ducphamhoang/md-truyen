### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 101–120)
*   **The Sirius Investigation**: Klein tracks down Sirius Arapis (a fabric merchant) through the Divination Club and Deville Library. Sirius is a member of the Aurora Order (Cực Quang Hội) who sold the Antigonus notebook to Welch alongside Hanass Vincent.
*   **The Clown Recipe**: After killing Sirius, Klein uses Spirit Mediumship and Dream Divination to extract the 'Clown' (Hề Giả) recipe. He learns that the Antigonus family's pathway is indeed the 'Seer' (Chiêm Bốc Gia) pathway.
*   **Psychology Alchemists Informant**: Klein identifies Dast Goodyear, a doctor at Grimhill Asylum, as a 'Khán Giả' (Spectator) and member of the Psychology Alchemists (Hội Tâm Lý Luyện Kim). Klein successfully blackmails/recruits him as a 'Line-man' (cơ sở ngầm) for the Nighthawks.
*   **Audrey's New Contacts**: Audrey meets Fors Wall (a writer) and Hugh (a bounty hunter). Audrey realizes she can use her social status to help them, while Fors (Sequence 9: Apprentice) and Hugh (Sequence 9: Arbiter) provide her entry into a genuine Backlund Beyonder circle.
*   **The Lanvus Scam**: A major fraud involving a fake iron mine, led by a man named Lanvus (Lanvus), has devastated many middle-class families in Tingen, leading to a spike in suicides and 'natural' deaths in the Lower Street (Hạ Nhai).
*   **Chanis Gate Incident**: Sealed Artifact 3-0625 (Misfortune Doll) shows signs of 'living' characteristics when it displays a mysterious vertical eye symbol to Klein while he is on guard duty, likely influenced by the previously stored Antigonus notebook.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS
*   **Klein ↔ Dast Goodyear**: Professional/Informant. Klein provides 'protection' for Dast in exchange for internal information on the Psychology Alchemists.
*   **Audrey ↔ Fors Wall & Hugh**: Patron/Friends. Fors and Hugh provide Beyonder knowledge/materials, while Audrey uses her noble influence to assist with their legal troubles.
*   **Klein ↔ Henry**: Client/Detective. Klein hires the Henry Private Detective Agency to track the 'Red Chimney' and locate Dast Goodyear.
