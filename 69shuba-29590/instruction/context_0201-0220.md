### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 201–216)
* **The Secret of the Nighthawks**: Dunn Smith reveals a hidden practice of the Church: when a Nighthawk dies normally, their Beyonder characteristic remains. Dunn uses a special ritual to consume these characteristics, not for power, but to keep his fallen comrades (like Adelaide, Kenley, and others) "alive" within his dreams so they can continue to fight together.
* **The Clown's Digestion**: Klein realizes the true essence of the "Hề Giả" (Clown) sequence: it is about using a smile to mask the helplessness, pain, and despair of one's destiny. This realization significantly advances his digestion of the potion.
* **The Four Emperors' War**: Roselle's diary entries describe historical secrets of the Fourth Epoch. He learns of the "Four Emperors' War" involving the Solomon Empire ([所罗门帝国] - Black Emperor), the Tudor Dynasty ([图铎王朝] - Blood Emperor), the Trunsoest Empire ([特伦索斯特帝国] - Night Emperor), and the Underworld ([冥皇] - Death).
* **Elite Nighthawks**: Leonard Mitchell, grief-stricken and vengeful after the Tingen tragedy, applies to join the **Găng Tay Đỏ** (Red Gloves), an elite mobile task force of the Evernight Church that hunts high-level threats across regional boundaries.
* **Volume 2 - Faceless**: Klein officially moves to Backlund to begin his hunt for Ince Zangwill and Lanvus. He takes on the name Sherlock Moriarty and starts his career as a private detective.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS
* **Dunn Smith ↔ Fallen Tingen Nighthawks**: A tragic yet protective bond; Dunn serves as a living container for their memories and spirits within his dream world.
* **Leonard Mitchell ↔ Pallez** (Implicit/Secret): Leonard relies on an internal entity (implied via his "listening" and sudden determination) to aid his revenge quest.
