# NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 0231-0240)

### The Conflict with the Ambassador
Sherlock Moriarty (Klein) successfully defends himself against Meursault, a hitman from the Zmanger Gang sent by the Intis Ambassador, **Bakerland Jean Madan**. Sherlock kills Meursault, secures his Beyonder characteristic (Hunter), and cleverly involves the official Loen military forces (**Thẩm Huấn Giả**) to shield himself and pressure the Ambassador. To further neutralize the threat, Sherlock uses a paper on his desk to "accidentally" leak information about the boy **Ian Wright** to the Intis agents, diverting their focus away from him.

### The Tarot Club's First Official Mission
In the gray fog, Mr. Fool (Klein) officially issues a mission to the Tarot Club: the assassination of Ambassador Bakerland. **Khán Giả (Audrey)** and **The Hanged Man (Alger)** both accept. Audrey plans to outsource the task to other Beyonder circles, while Alger treats it as a high-stakes investigation and hit. In return, Audrey requests the formula and ingredients for **Bác Sĩ Tâm Lý** (Psychologist). Meanwhile, **The Sun (Derrick)** receives the formula for **Kỳ Quang Nhân** (Light Supplicant) from Mr. Fool.

### Revelation of High Sequences and Ancient History
Through Roselle's diaries, Klein discovers information about Sequence 2 of the Seer pathway, **Kỳ Tích Sư** (Miracle Invoker), and the existence of the Monster pathway's Sequence 1, **Thủy Ngân Chi Xà** (Snake of Mercury). Derrick shares ancient history about the Dragon (Spectator) pathway, detailing the **Không Tưởng Chi Long** (Dragon of Imagination) Ankewei'erd and the **Ác Mộng Chi Long** (Nightmare Dragon) Alesuohode, whose abilities strangely parallel the descriptions of Sealed Artifact 0-08.

### Progress and New Contacts
**Hugh** (formerly Xio) begins working for a mysterious masked man to obtain the ingredients for **Trị An Quan** (Sheriff). Audrey advances to **Đọc Tâm Giả** (Mind Reader). Klein makes contact with **Maric**, a Beyonder in the Braveheart Bar who controls **Hoạt Thi** (Living Zombies), although Maric initially refuses to serve as a bodyguard due to the danger associated with the Intis Ambassador.
