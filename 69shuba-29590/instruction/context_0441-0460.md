### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 440–459)
*   **Prince Edessak’s Secret:** Prince Edessak Augustus is in love with a commoner woman whom he keeps confined at Red Rose Manor. Klein discovers this woman is linked to Talim Dumont's death via a high-level curse (divined as a blue sapphire ring on a slender hand). This woman is a powerful entity, possibly a high-sequence Beyonder or tied to a '0' grade artifact.
*   **Sequence 6 Advancement:** Klein officially consumes the "Faceless" (Vô Diện Nhân) potion. He gains the ability to change his appearance, height (within 10cm), and scent, but learns the core acting principle: "You can play anyone, but you must remain yourself."
*   **The Evil Spirit's Bargain:** In the ruins under Williams Street, the trapped evil spirit attempts to bargain with Klein and Sharron. It reveals the existence of "Blasphemy Cards" (Bài Báng Bổ), specifically the "Red Priest" (Hồng Tế Ty) card, and mentions the ancient organization "Redemption Rose" (Cứu Thục Tường Vi).
*   **Sanguine Prophecy:** Nibis Odora, an ancient Sanguine ancestor, wakes from a dream with a revelation from the Primordial Ancestor (Lilith). He instructs Emlyn White to pray to "The Fool," identifying Emlyn as a key figure for the upcoming apocalypse.
*   **City of Silver Exploration:** Derrick's team explores a city in the darkness and finds a temple of the Fallen Creator. They encounter a boy named Jack who claims to be looking for the "Lord's Sanctuary."
