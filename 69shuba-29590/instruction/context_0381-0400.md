### **NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 381–400)**
*   **The Black Emperor Legend:** Following the raid on Capin's villa, the public and newspapers dub the mysterious attacker "The Black Emperor" (Hắc Hoàng Đế) or "The Chivalrous Thief" (Hiệp Đạo). Klein used the "Black Emperor" card to enhance his spirit body and left Tarot cards (Judgement and Emperor) at the scene.
*   **Official Investigation:** The investigation into Capin's death involved **Ace Snake** (Archbishop of Storms). They noted the Tarot card signature and linked it to the Lanvus incident.
*   **Worm of Time:** The parasite removed from Derrick is identified as a **Thời Chi Trùng (Worm of Time)**, a vessel for Amon's avatars. It is a high-level Beyonder material linked to the Marauder pathway and time-related domains.
*   **Spirit World Lore (Seven Lights):** Through the book *Linh Giới Kiến Văn*, Klein learns of the **Thất Đạo Tịnh Quang (Seven Pure Lights)**, high-level entities in the Spirit World that represent different colors and domains of knowledge. They form the **Tịnh Quang Huynh Đệ Hội (Brotherhood of Pure Light)**.
*   **The Apocalypse Prophecy:** **Venitan (Yellow Light)** prophesied a world-ending event occurring within 200 years (likely within 20-50 years from the current era) involving "gaze from the stars."
*   **Will Auceptin's Mystery:** The boy Will Auceptin is linked to a **Thủy Ngân Chi Xà (Snake of Mercury)**. He used a paper crane as a medium to send a warning/dream to Dr. Allen, signaling he is being hunted by a "snake."
*   **Exposure in City of Silver:** Under the guidance of "The Hanged Man," Derrick (The Sun) uses the **Toàn Hắc Chi Nhãn (All-Black Eye)** to expose the corruption of the expedition team members who have been influenced by the "True Creator" at a fallen temple.
