### NEW STORY CONTEXT
*   **The Black Emperor Card**: Audrey assisted Klein in identifying a specific bookmark at the Roselle Memorial Exhibition. Klein successfully stole it, discovering it is a **Vật Phẩm Phong Ấn (Sealed Artifact)** known as a **Bia Tiết Lộ (Blasphemy Card)**, specifically the **Hắc Hoàng Đế (Black Emperor)** card. It contains the complete potion formulas for the **Luật Sư (Lawyer)** pathway up to Sequence 0.
*   **Elimination of the Devil**: The serial killer, a mutated dog of the **Ác Ma (Devil)** pathway (Sequence 6), was neutralized by official Beyonders using a special artifact that created an isolated combat environment.
*   **Rose School of Thought Conflict**: Klein deepened his connection with **Sharron** and **Maric**. They belong to the **Tiết Chế Phái (Temperance Faction)** of the **Hồng Phấn Học Phái (Rose School of Thought)**, which is at odds with the **Phóng Túng Phái (Indulgence Faction)**. Sharron is a **Sequence 5: Oán Hồn (Wraith)**.
*   **The Abraham Mystery**: Klein explored **Phố Weldy (Weldy Street)** and found a notebook from the **Gia tộc Abraham (Abraham Family)**. It reveals their curse: members often lose control or go mad during full moons due to the ravings of **"Mr. Door" (Ngài Cửa)**, likely their ancestor **Bethel Abraham**.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS

*   **Audrey ↔ Psychology Alchemists**: Audrey is being observed by **Madam Norma**, a potential recruiter for the **Hội Tâm Lý Luyện Kim**.
