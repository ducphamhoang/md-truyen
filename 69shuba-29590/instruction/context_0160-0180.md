## NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 161–180)
*   **The Morse Town Distraction**: Mr. Azik creates a series of harmless hauntings in Morse Town to provide Klein a reason to apply for Sealed Artifact 3-0782. Klein uses this opportunity to secretly create high-level 'Sunflame Charms' above the Gray Fog by stealing the artifact's 'Sun' energy.
*   **The Death of Old Neil**: Klein discovers Old Neil is attempting to use 'Life Alchemy' to resurrect his long-dead fiance, Celeste. Old Neil has already begun losing control due to the constant whispers of the 'Hidden Sage'.

This event deeply affects Klein's resolve to follow the 'Acting Method'.
*   **Sequence 8 Advancement**: Klein passes a formal assessment by Crestet Cesim, a High-ranking Deacon of the Church. He successfully consumes the 'Clown' potion and advances to Sequence 8.

*   **The Maynard Incident**: In his capacity as a police consultant, Klein investigates the sudden death of John Maynard, a Member of Parliament. He discovers Maynard died of 'natural causes' (exhaustion) during an affair with Madam Sharon. During a private 'corpse inspection', Maynard temporarily turns into a living corpse due to the presence of Azik's Copper Whistle.
*   **The Hidden Sage & Mosaic Ascetic Order**: The entity known as the 'Hidden Sage' is confirmed as a 'living' deity/concept that transmits dangerous knowledge directly into the minds of the 'Mystery Pryer' pathway members, leading to high rates of madness.
