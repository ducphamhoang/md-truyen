### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 480–498)
*   **The End of Volume 2: "The Faceless"**: Klein (as Sherlock Moriarty) survives the encounter with Mr. A by using Azik's messenger as a shield and escapes to the Tarsock River. The Great Fog of Backlund officially ends with over 21,000 direct deaths and 40,000 more from plague. Prince Edessak Augustus commits suicide. Klein leaves Backlund to avoid the influence of Sealed Artifact 0-08 and the Church's investigation.
*   **Volume 3: "The Traveler"**: Klein moves to Pritz Harbor and takes a new identity: **Gehrman Sparrow**, a cold and lethal bounty hunter/adventurer. He boards the steamship **White Agate** (Bạch Mã Não) heading for the **Rorsted Archipelago** (Quần đảo Rorsted) to seek Mermaids for his Sequence 5 advancement.
*   **The Sea Rules and Legends**: Through interactions with Captain Elland Kag and former adventurer Cleves, Klein learns about sea hazards, the behavior of **Murlocs/Fishmen** (Ngư nhân), and the six great sea legends: "Death's Key", "Fountain of Youth", "Solomon's Legacy", "Ghost Empire", "Lost Newins", and the "Sunken Laurel".
