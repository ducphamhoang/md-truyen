### NEW STORY CONTEXT (Chapters 141–160)
*   **Divination of the Sun**: Klein attempts to divine the origin of the golden liquid from Sealed Artifact 3-0782 (Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem) above the Gray Fog. He glimpses the "Eternal Blazing Sun" (Vĩnh Hằng Liệt Dương) and is nearly incinerated. This event damages the palace on the fog but grants Klein knowledge of the Sun pathway sequences, the recipe for Sunflame Charms, and the secret that gods should not be looked upon directly.
*   **Pathway Switching Secret**: From Roselle's diary, Klein learns that at Sequence 5 and above, some pathways can switch (e.g., Sleepless with Corpse Collector, Savant with Mystery Pryer). This reveals the existence of the Second Blasphemy Slate (Bia Tiết Lộ thứ hai).
*   **Daly's Guidance**: Daly Simone (now a Sequence 6 Spirit Guide) visits Klein via a summoned spirit messenger. She confirms she uses the "Acting Method" and encourages Klein to help Dunn Smith understand it. Klein uses this context to justify his rapid digestion of the Seer potion and submits a formal application to advance to Sequence 8: Clown.
*   **Azik's Revelation**: Klein takes Mr. Azik to the Lamud castle. Azik realizes he is indeed Baron Lamud and has lived multiple lives over 1,000 years, losing his memory in each cycle. He discovers the villain who stole his "child's" (the Black Knight's) skull is the same mastermind manipulating Klein's coincidences.
*   **Tarot Club Expansion**: "The Sun" (Derrick Berg) officially begins participating. He provides the "Đọc Tâm Giả" (Đọc Tâm Giả) recipe to Audrey in exchange for the "Bard" recipe and Roselle's diaries. Klein acts as the middleman, establishing a system for anonymous bank transfers in Backlund via the Backlund Bank.
*   **The Qilangos Hunt**: The Tarot Club discusses "Hurricane Admiral" Qilangos, who has infiltrated Backlund. He possesses "Creeping Hunger" (Sự Đói Khát Luân Chuyển), a glove that allows him to "graze" souls and use their powers, effectively making him a multi-pathway Sequence 5 threat.

### NEW RELATIONSHIPS
*   **Klein ↔ The Eternal Blazing Sun**: Hostile/Forbidden. Klein's curiosity led to a direct confrontation that almost destroyed his soul.
*   **Klein ↔ Daly Simone**: Peers in Secrecy. Both understand the Acting Method and cooperate to subtly guide Dunn Smith without alerting the Church's high-level restrictions.
*   **Klein ↔ The Mastermind**: Targeted. Klein is now actively using his resources (including Azik and his detective work) to track the Red Chimney and the entity manipulating his fate.
